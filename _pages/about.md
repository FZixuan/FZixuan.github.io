Welcome to my homepage! In Fall 2023, I started my PhD program in the [Department of Industrial and Systems Engineering](https://www.ise.ufl.edu/) at the University of Florida. 
I'm working with [Dr. Aleksandr Kazachkov](https://akazachk.github.io/) in the Center of Applied Optimization. 
My research interests include helping mixed integer programming solvers make smarter decisions with a focus on better use of cutting planes (cuts) and computational economics (fair devision, kidney exchange, etc.). I am also the secretary of the [INFORMS Student Chapter at UF](https://www.ise.ufl.edu/informs/) since May 2024. I helped organizing various interesting activities to gather the OR community at UF, including but not limited to seminars, graduate student talks, tutorials, and social events.

I spend my spare time on dancing (chinese dance, ballet basics, sportive latin american ballroom dance), listening to music, making handicrafts, and playing with my cat Yuanxiao :smiley_cat: .

Feel free to reach out to me if you are interested in my research, my hobbies, our student chapter, or just want to say hi! :blush:
